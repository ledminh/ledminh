# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Minh Le, a passionate web developer based in Greenville, South Carolina. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from San Jose State University. During my academic years, I predominantly worked with C++ and Java for most of my projects, but my heart has always been in web development. Since graduating, I've been dedicatedly crafting web applications.

## What I Bring to the Table

- **Proficiency**: I'm proficient in JavaScript and have a solid grasp of TypeScript, using it almost every day.
- **Frameworks**: I primarily use ReactJS and NextJS to build applications.
- **Styling**: I've recently adopted TailwindCSS, and it has quickly become one of my favorite tools for creating beautiful and responsive designs.

## Current Focus

I'm currently focused on enhancing my skills and building a standout portfolio to kickstart my career. Here's what I've achieved so far:

1. **[Learning Journal App](https://github.com/ledminh/learning-journal)**: I built a learning journal app using Next.js. This app helps me document my learning journey and practice explaining complex computer science concepts.

2. **[Portfolio Website](https://github.com/ledminh/ledminh.dev)**: I've created a portfolio website that showcases my work, educational background, skills, and a bit about myself.

3. **Algorithm Practice**: I'm dedicated to reviewing algorithms, data structures, and solving LeetCode problems to sharpen my problem-solving skills.

## What's Next?

I'm excited about the journey ahead as I continue to expand my knowledge in web development. I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and make a meaningful impact.

Wish me luck on my journey! ðŸš€
